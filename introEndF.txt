JOURNAL ENTRY #1
DAY 1


"Today is the day. I have decided that now is the time for me
to set out on the open sea. My father does not approve of my
decision. In fact, he forbid me from leaving. However, tonight
I will set course! With or without his knowledge, I am leaving
my homeland.

The land of Jax has been amazing to me and my family. The people 
here love my father and his leadership as King. He has done very 
well, and someday I hope to live up to the standards he has 
unintentionally imposed upon me. It is a lot to live up to a
noble King afterall. I am up for the challenge, however. I know
I can follow in my father's footsteps, and make the right 
decisions for my people.

But before I can do that, I need to leave.

There is a huge world out here. A world that has not even been
fully explored! I need to know what is out there before I can
settle in here. Deep down, I know this is what I must do.

So I will set sail tonight. I will be alone. 

And I cannot wait for the hour."

Day 4

"My course is clear!

Well, not really, but I am on a course, Indeed! I am a few days
out, and there appears to be no one following me. I did not
expect a pursuit, considering how unlikely it would be for my 
father to know the direction I am traveling. He might get close,
but at this point I am convinced that I will not be found.

So now, it is just me and the open ocean! I am tracking my course
by the stars, in case I run low on supplies and need to return
home. Who knows if Father will even want me as the Prince by then.

It is worth the risk."

DAY 11

"I just passed by a large island. I believe it was Makros, which
we have had a good realationship with, but have never really been
friends. This was confirmed when, as I neared the island, they
fired a warning shot. It was a large rock which they launched
into the ocean and landed within 100 metris of our ship. 

I was not worried, but I may or may not have gotten sick due to
the waves. Apparently, I have not yet developed my sea legs."

JOURNAL ENTRY #4
DAY 19

"Not much happening out here. I didn't think I would find
anything of note right away, but not seeing land for 8 days has
been more difficult than I thought it would be. I am beginning to
feel a bit claustrophobic. 

Ironic, considering there is nothing but open air around me."

JOURNAL ENTRY #5
DAY 31

"It has been about a month since my journey began, and I finally 
have the chance to walk on solid ground. 

I managed to find Torcorano. I know that our lands have had trade
agreements in the past. There is not much benefit in working
together considering the distance between us, but it is always 
good to have an ally.

My father used to tell me that. "Make as many allies as you can,
Seth. Working together with those around you is the only way we
can all live happily."

I always took those words to heart.

So I docked in the port city of Naito. It is beautiful here.
Very different from any town in the land of Jax. My plan is
to meet with the highest authorities I can convince to talk to
me, and see if I can get some insight on a good direction to go
from here. Afterall, I don't really want to be on the water for
the next year."


.................................................................

JOURNAL ENTRY #6
DAY 35

"After staying a few days in Torcorano, I am once again back on
the sea. I talked with many folk who were familiar with the
local seas, and heard many different voices on where I should
go next. The poeople here were very friendly indeed!

After everything, in the spirit of my goal, I have decided to
go in the one direction that was not reccomended to me. It is
not as if I was told I should not go this way, but it was not
among the directions I was told I should go.

And so, I will go!"


.................................................................

JOURNAL ENTRY #7
Day 51

"My spririts have been driven by my heart's desire. I have been
on this course for many days, and have not seen anyting but
water. I can feel my heart begining to clench, and the spark
of panic has officially set in. 

I have supplies to last me ten times what I have been through, so
I do not fear exhaustion. 

I fear the unknown.

I fear nothing. There is nothing out here. And so, I am afraid.
What if I never find any land? At what point do I admit defeat
and turn about? Once I get through half my food stores, I will
have no choice, and that is still 20 or 30 days away. But I
did not anticipate what it would be like to not interact with
another person for long periods of time."


.................................................................
*


JOURNAL ENTRY #8
DAY 90

"I am at a point of no return. If I do not turn around and head
back towards Jax, I may run out of food. Every bone in my body
is telling me to do this. I have gotten used to being alone on
the sea, but there is still no substitute for another person.

Can I even proceed? What am I even doing here? 

...
But there has to be something near, right? The farther I go, the
more likely I am to find land. At least, I think so. This world
can't be infinite, right? There are plenty of land masses around
Jax. I never thought it would be like this out here. 

I am not yet sure what I am going to do."


.................................................................

JOURNAL ENTRY #9
DAY 118

"I may have made a huge mistake."


.................................................................
*


JOURNAL ENTRY #10
DAY 143

"There has been nothing to say. There is nothing here. I don't
even see fish anymore. 

Where am I?"


.................................................................
*


JOURNAL ENTRY #11
DAY 161

"I just saw a fish. 

I wept."


.................................................................
*


JOURNAL ENTRY #12
DAY 194

"This may be it. I can see the edge of the world. The
storm in front of me is unlike anything I have ever seen.

And I am heading right into it.

The wind has been picking up for some time now. There is nothing
I can do to change my course at this point. I am all in.

If someone finds this, tell my Father that I always love him. 
Even though he was kind of an ass. 

Here we go..."

HOW TO PLAY 'PRISM'

	In Prism, you are playing as Seth, and will control
	his actions using the keyboard to type commands. The
	majority of commands in the game will be a 2-word 
	phrase. The first word will be 1 of 5 ACTION words, 
	while the second will be the TARGET of the action.

	There are a few exceptions which will be detailed
	later in this tutorial.

...............................................................

	--ACTION WORDS--
	The first word of each two word command is the ACTION
	word. There are only five ACTION words that will be 
	used for the game. The words are described as follows:


	-LOOK:
	Use the LOOK command whenever you want to take a closer
	look at something. It can be anything Seth sees in his
	adventure, whether it is an object, a structure, or a 
	character. Look is also used to inspect an item Seth
	is carrying in his inventory. 

	You can only look at something within the area Seth is 
	currently in, or anytime for objects in his inventory.


	--TALK:
	There are many locals in Galilei that Seth will have to
	interact with in order to further his quest. Use the 
	TALK command whenever you would like to talk with
	someone within earshot of Seth.


	--TAKE:
	If there is something that Seth wishes to take, and it
	it won't result in Seth getting thrown in the town jail,
	use the TAKE command to pick something up and take it
	with you. If Seth pick's something up, it will be added
	to his inventory. (Inventory can be accessed by typing
	'inventory' or simply 'i')


	--GO:
	The GO command is used when you want Seth to travel in a
	certain direction. In the game, there are only four
	possible directions to move (North, South, East, West).
	To move Seth, the command would be "go south", for
	example.
	
	Depending on where Seth is in the world, he will not
	always be able to go a certain way. Pay attention to
	the descriptions of the area in order to know which
	directions are possible. 


	--USE:
	The USE command is a little more involved then the other
	ACTION words, because if Seth wishes to use an item from
	his inventory, he will also need a target to use it
	with, creating a second target word. If you use an
	object, and it is valid, you will be prompted to
	declare whom or what you would like to use that item
	with. 

	For example, if you have a pencil, and you wish to
	sharpen it, the commands would look as follows:


	'What would you like to do?'
command: use pencil

	'What/Whom would you like to use it with?'
command: sharpener

	
	This would effectively sharpen the Pencil. If you wish
	to give an item to someone, the second target would
	be the person you wish to give it to. If you have a
	rose, and would like to give it to emily, the commands
	would look as follows:


	'What would you like to do?'
command: use rose
	
	'What/Whom would you like to use it with?'
command: emily


................................................................

	--TARGET WORDS--
	The second word in each phrase will be the target of
	the action word.
	
	If Seth wishes to LOOK at a box, the target word will 
	be BOX, and so the command to look at the box will be :

		-look box

	If you meet a man named Greg, and you wish to TALK
	with Greg, GREG will be the target word, and so the 
	command to talk to greg will be:

		-talk greg
	
	If you find a fun stick that you want Seth to TAKE,
	the target will be STICK, and the command to pick
	up the stick will be:

		-take stick

	If you are tired of everything around you, and want
	to GO somewhere else, the target will be whatever
	direction you want to go. If you find yourself on
	a spaceship, and there are two exits out of the room
	(north and east) your target will be either NORTH or
	EAST, so the command to move east will be:

		-go east

	NOTE: When moving, you can shorten it by simply typing
	the first letter of the direct instead of the whole
	word. For example:

		-go s: Seth will go south
		-go n: Seth will go north

	If you want seth to give his shirt to the Mayor, the
	target will be MAYOR, and the commands to USE the shirt
	with the Mayor will be:
		
		-use shirt
		-mayor

................................................................

	--GENERAL GAMEPLAY NOTES--
	
	-To look at the items Seth is currently carrying, you
	type the word 'inventory' as the full command. For
	quicker access, you may also simply type the letter
	'i'.

	-Remember that the USE command is a two step process.
	When you use something, if it is a valid command,
	the game will prompt you to enter whom or what
	you want to use the item with.

	-Look at everything you possiblY can, everywhere
	you go. If something is mentioned in the game, there is
	a good chance it is something that is useful. Try to
	look at anything in the scene description. It is also
	possible to look at something within the description of
	something you have looked at.

	-Talk to everyone you encounter. If they won't talk to
	you, think about how you might win their trust so that
	they will. Most of the information you learn will be
	from talking with people.
	 
	-It is always recommended to make a map.

	-Every target used in the game is contained within the
	game itself. You will never have to try and guess a word,
	as it will be mentioned SOMEWHERE else in the game. This
	is why talking to everyone and looking at everything is
	important.

The first thing you notice as you come back to conciousness
is the immense, throbbing pain in your head! You slowly
open your eyes as they adjust to the light, and you feel a 
large bump on your head.

As you regain your senses, you find yourself laying down in a
bed. The bed is in a large, ornately decorated room which is
filled with other beds, all of which are empty. As you look
around, you see that you are not alone.

VINCENT:
	"Ah! You have finally come back to us! Seth.. you did
	it. I honestly was not sure whether or not you were up	
	to the task, but you proved my lack of faith to be
	unfounded. The Prism has been neutralized, and the
	Basileus no longer has his hold over the land of
	Galilei."
SETH:
	"So... the spell has come to an end? Are the people who
	live here free of it's effects?"
VINCENT:
	"That is accurate. It has been many, many years, but
	the spell has finally been defeated. No longer will
	they live everyday perpetually. 

	They will also begin to remember who they are, and 
	will begin to understand what has happened to them.
	I do not know what effect this will have...."
SETH:
	"What do you mean?"
VINCENT:
	"Living the same day for almost 2 centuries can take
	a toll on a person. I worry that some may not be able
	to accept the reality which they find themeselves in.
	But, we cannot worry about that now, it is for another
	day. You have won, Seth, and we can start re-build 
	this land. Come, let us see if Bailey has recovered,
	as she is the rightfult Queen of Galilei.

You follow Vincent out of the room. Soon enough, you see that
you were in the heart of the castle, which you reason was an
infirmary. As you and Vincent leave the castle, you notice
that the majority of it has been destroyed, with the high
towers collapsed in on themselves.
