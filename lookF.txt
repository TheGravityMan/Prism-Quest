Well, you may have been wrong about the spider. It is quite 
clearly an octopus statue. Now that it has been cleared
of dirt, it is quite remarkable. The worksmanship is top
notch, and you cannot see any faults or defects. You do kind
of miss the spider, though.

The desert seems to go in all directions from here. It meets

town to the south, and the outline of a palace to the east. 
There are plenty of smaller hills in that direction, however.
Since you played music with Samara, she has told you how to 
get through. So if you want to go to the palace, you feel
comfortable enough that you could make it.

the biggest structure in the land of Jax, and inspired awe into
anyone who set eyes upon it. But this palace.... this palace
is much larger and more ornate than anything you have ever
seen. You can see hundreds of small windows along the stone
walls that encompass the structure, but seen no one at all
within. It is hard for you to imagine a gigantic casle like
this to be empty. What a waste of space! 

As awe inspring as it is, you must turn back to the task at

The only way to directly get into the castle is through the

which is currently facing towards the sky so that none may
cross. You wonder what the two guards would do if they were
directly besieged by an enemy?

You consider this as an option for a moment, but realize that
with their weapons and armor, you wouldn't stand a chance
against these two. Better to find another way into the palace.

surrounded by shrubs, and spiky shrubs at that. However, for
some reason the monolith has been placed about 50 meters to
the west of the gate. There is no other monolith that you can
see from your viewpoint.

The monolith is essentially a large piece of stone which has
been chiseled into the shape of an older man who is looking
towards the sky. His arms are pointed away with palms facing
up, welcoming the heavens.
