You decide to give your gold over to the guard in order to
sharpen your knife. He chuckles slightly as he takes your money,
but then looks at you straight in the eye.

GUARD:
	"Trust me, mate. I'll make sure yer blade is sharp as a
	mermaid's wit."

---------------------------------------------------------------
---------------------------------------------------------------

The guard begins to sharpen your blade. After a few minutes, he
hands your dagger back to you.

Now that your dagger has been sharpened, you have no problem
using it to cut down the overgrown shrubs and plants near
the bottom of the fence. You slowly chip away, and soon you
have created a small opening in the fence large enough for
you to fit through. 

It looks like you found your way into town, afterall.
Good job!

...
Darn. You have relied on your dagger a few too many times. 
While the blade was sharp, it was fragile, and cutting the 
shrubs was the last cut the dagger could make. You say a silent 
'thank you' before leaving it behind.

PERFECT THROW! You slice the rope near the top of the wall and
the rope falls to the ground. Feeling proud of yourself, you
casually walk over and take the rope. Luckily, no one else is

With your coil of rope, you tie one end to the severed part 
the well's rope. Once it is secure, you take the bucket and 
attach it to the other end of your rope and begin to rotate
the pulley attached to the well. Feeling confident in your
work, you lower the bucket down into the well, hoping to get 
some fresh water! 

And who knows, maybe the town will thank you for fixing their
well?

After a minute, you pull the bucket back up. It is indeed 
filled with fresh water! After taking a few large gulps of the
much needed fresh water, you notice something else in the
bucket.

You look into the bucket and see a small doll. It is, of
course, the Green Power Ranger. You take the doll.

Thinking that this might be the compass Lucious mentioned to
you that he lost in the woods, you take it out and hand it
to him. His eyes light up upon seeing it! 
---------------------------------------------------------------
---------------------------------------------------------------

LUCIOUS:
	"That is it! I cannot believe you found that! I looked
	everywhere out in the woods for it!
SETH:
	"I found it inside of a large, old tree near the town
	gate. I was going to use it to help in my travels,
	seeing as how it still works. But it is rightfully
	yours, so here you go.
LUCIOUS:
	"Master Seth, I cannot thank you enough. This compass
	has been with my family for many years. Although, I
	can't even remember how long it has been since I had
	last seen it."

---------------------------------------------------------------
---------------------------------------------------------------
Lucious' demeanor changes briefly, looking as though he just
had a realization. He pauses for a moment before speaking
once again.
---------------------------------------------------------------
---------------------------------------------------------------

LUCIOUS:
	"Anyways, I really wish there was something I couuld 
	offer you to help in its' stead. Regrettably, I don't
	sell anything here but my horses."
SETH:
	"Please, you don't owe me anything. I am just happy I
	could help. Besides, a horse might be a bit too large
	to fit in my pocket.
LUCIOUS:
	"Of course! Well, if you ever decide you want to 
	journey through the desert to the north, I might be
	of assistance."
SETH:
	"I was never too good with horseriding in my homeland,
	but i will remember your offer."
LUCIOUS:
	"Your homeland? Where abouts might that be?"
SETH:
	"I am from a large country called Jax. It is very far 
	to the south. Errr... maybe the west? Admittedly, I 
	actually am not too familiar with where exactly I am. 
	
	Jax is a beautiful place. Many forests which are home
	to different species of animals who co-exist with the
	people there. I love it there. The only reason I left
	was so that I could finally see the world which I had
	only heard of. It would seem I may have journeyed a
	bit too far, however, as my boat was caught in a storm
	and crashed ashore on your fair island."
LUCIOUS:
	"That is quite a tale! I love a good adventure! I plan
	on setting out on one myself before too long. I am not
	sure what is stopping me, though. Must be getting old!
	
	Well, I can at least try to help you feel more 
	comfortable with your surroundings. This is a great 
	little town, and we mostly keep to ourselves. The
	Basileus is in charge of the entire island, though
	he doesn't make his prescence felt too much. If you
	haven't yet, I strongly reccomend going to the 
	Blacksmith to the south. Bailey is an absolute joy of
	a person, and her weapons are the best I have ever
	seen. In fact, I know she has a few things that
	a generous man like yourself may be able to help with. 
	You can never have enough friends, afterall!"
SETH:
	"Thank you Lucious. I have seen her shop, but it was
	closed. Perhaps I shall go back and see if she is in.
	I am sure I will see you again."

---------------------------------------------------------------

Lucious smiles at you, gives another thanks, and goes back to
work tending his horses.

	of this land. I lost everything aboard my ship, but I
	survived. Which is what I did for many days in

recieved from Samara. It is the only song you figured out how
to play, but you still get a small crowd forming around you.
As you finish the tune, the people begin to clap.
---------------------------------------------------------------
---------------------------------------------------------------

JOHN:
	"Ah, Seth! That was indeed a lovely little tune! How
	did you know I was a fan of the musical arts? Pray
	tell, what is that wonderful implement?"
SETH:
	"I traded for it in the desert. It sounds greay, does 
	it not? Would you be interested in trading for it?"
JOHN:
	"Most certainly! Do you see anything you might find of
	value amongst my collection?"
SETH:
	"I wondered if you might find it in yourself to part
	the guitar. I used to play when I was younger, I
	I thought to try and pick it up again."
JOHN:
	"'Tis only fair to trade one musical instrument for 
	another. The guitar is yours."

You take the guitar.

ENZO:

ENZO:

	at this."

---------------------------------------------------------------

Enzo takes the statue and begins to inspect it. After a quick
lookover, he retrieves a small, circular piece of glass and
looks through it, slowly scanning the statue.
---------------------------------------------------------------

ENZO:

ENZO:
	"Atta boy, you got good taste. Here ya go!"

---------------------------------------------------------------

Enzo hands you a small leather sack. You peek into the sack and
see it is filled with green and blue jewels. You assume they 
are very valuable around this area, and hope that Enzo is not
shorting you on this exchange. You put the sack of jewels away.

then on the strange machine at the far end of the shop. You
find, unsurprisingly, that they easily click into place. As
soon as the cogs are in the machine, it slowly starts to move.

The cogs turn each other until the larger one embedded in the
machine moves as well. The machine begins to buzz as it works,
and after a few moments, a small drawer opens out from the
side of the device. You reach in and find a small, gold key,
which you take. 

You hear a noise coming from behind you.

DARIO:
	"OH! Uh, What did you do?! You can't do that!"

---------------------------------------------------------------
---------------------------------------------------------------
Dario starts to panic and pace behind is counter, mumbling
incoherently to himself. He lets out a quick scream, opens the
door to the backroom and leaves the floor unnattended. You
expect him to come back, but he does not. 

Starting that machine and finding the key really sent him
into a panic.

---------------------------------------------------------------

You hand the bag of jewels to Igor. He takes the sack without
saying anything and looks inside. His eyes light up.
---------------------------------------------------------------
---------------------------------------------------------------

IGOR:
	"Oh. Oh! Oh wow! Seth! Igor thankful for Seth! You
	give this to Igor?!"
SETH:
	"Yes. I want you to get better, Igor. You said you like
	to wrestle, right? Use this to help you get better and
	become a professional."

---------------------------------------------------------------

Igor's face lights up
---------------------------------------------------------------

IGOR:
	"Yes! Seth! You wrestle Igor! Seth and Igor have match!
	Seth said to follow dreams!"
SETH:
	"Well, I.. errr.. yes I did. But I cannot wrestle, I am
	not trained..."
IGOR:
	"HA! Neither is Igor! But Igor show Seth! Igor show
	how to wrestle without dying!"

---------------------------------------------------------------
---------------------------------------------------------------
You really feel as though you should try to get out of this. 
But when it comes down to it, you are kind of interested in
what Igor is planning to do. 
Ok.
Let's have a wrestling match.
---------------------------------------------------------------

---------------------------------------------------------------
---------------------------------------------------------------
Igor reaches out to you with a nice looking slingshot in hand.
You begin to protest, but decide that a slingshot might come
in handy. You did give him a sack of jewels, after all.
---------------------------------------------------------------
---------------------------------------------------------------

SETH:
	"Thank you, Igor. I think I can find use of this.
	Perhaps our paths will cross again. A good day to you,

You approach Samara and take out the guitar you received from
John. Lucky for you, you were taught how to play guitar as
a child.
---------------------------------------------------------------
---------------------------------------------------------------

SETH:
	"Greetings, Samara. I was curious.. have you seen this
	before?"
SAMARA:
	"Nay! As you could guess, I have seen many musical 
	instruments in my travels, but that particular 
	implement is foreign to me! What does it sound like?"
SETH:
	"I will show you! Prepare your clarinet! I hope you
	been practicing."

---------------------------------------------------------------
---------------------------------------------------------------
You begin to play a song on the guitar that you learned as a
child. It is a variation on your nation's anthem that your
instructor showed you years ago. As you pick the notes, you
notice Samara staring intently at the instrument, mesmerized
by the notes. 

Not surprisingly, she begins to play with you after a few bars.
You knew she was talented, but her ability to pick up on the
notes you are playing is unmatched. Before long, the two of you
are playing off each other, creating new variations of the song
you have played a million times before. You lose yourself in
the music, and play with Samara for many minutes.

Eventually, the song comes to an end.
---------------------------------------------------------------
---------------------------------------------------------------

SAMARA:
	"I do not know about yourself, but I quite enjoyed
	that."
SETH:
	"As did I. Thank you for joining me! I was able to see
	a side of the song I had never heard before. It was
	enlightening. You are very skilled!"
SAMARA:
	"Ah, it is what I do. I have plent of spare time on my
	hands...

---------------------------------------------------------------
---------------------------------------------------------------
Samara looks at you intently for a few moments. You stare right
back into her eyes, hoping she can see you for who you truly
are.
---------------------------------------------------------------
---------------------------------------------------------------

SAMARA:
	"You are a strange one, Seth. But, I like that about
	you. I trust you. And so, I will tell you how to get to
	the palace. But please.. you did NOT hear this from me.
	This is still dangerous for me to do."

---------------------------------------------------------------
---------------------------------------------------------------
Samara explains how to get to the palace.
---------------------------------------------------------------
---------------------------------------------------------------

SETH:
	"Thank you so much for your help, Samara. I will return
	sometime and we can create music again someday. I think
	there are many lands far away from here who would love
	to hear you play."
SAMARA:
	"You flatter me, Seth. Please, come back anytime!"

You decide the monolith must be intentionally out of place
here at the Palace gates. It is far enough away from the guards
that they do not notice you using your hammer to dismantle
the monolith. YOu take it apart piece by peace, and to little
surprise, find a small tunnel built into the earth directly
behind where the monolith used to stand.

You do not know exactly where this tunnel leads, but you know
that there may be no other way into the Palace. The passage
leads to the North.

turn the key..

You feel a slight resistance, but with some effort, the key
turns, unlocking the chest.

You open the chest and examine it's contents. You expected it
to be full, considering how much it weighs. However, there is
one object inside. It is a small, green emerald, and it
appears to be in perfect condition. When you pick it up, you
can feel the power emanating from it.

This must be the object Vincent was talking about.

Feeling ready for the final battle, you place the emerald in
your pack.

As you take out the orb you found in the clock tower, you
can feel it perculating with energy. It feels warmer than
usual, and you can see whatever is contained within the glass
sphere is moving around quickly. 

You feel compelled to hold the sphere out towards Maiodin. As
you move the sphere closer, you can feel a force pushing
against your hand. You continue to push it out, and move
towards him as you push through the opposing force. 

the Basileus' face begins to turn as you move closer towards
him. He begins to stumble on his words, and you can see him
shaking as you aproach. It is almost as if you can feel energy
building between the orb and Maiodin, and soon enough you
find yourself directly in front of him.

Without warning, the energy reaches a point where it can no 
longer be contained. There is a blinding flash of light, and
you hear a loud scream from the direction of Maiodin. You lurch
forward as the force pushing against you ceases, and when your
eyes adjust to the scene, you see the Maidoin lying on his
back, grabbing his head and screaming. 

That worked well!

With the Maiodin incapacitated, you see your chance to end
this once and for all!

You decide to approach the huge crystal in the center of the
room. With The Basileus incapacitated, you realize that this
may be your only chance. 

The crystal pulses with power. You feel a force pushing back
against you, but you push through. Soon, you are right upon
it. 

It is the most perfect crystal you have ever seen. The power
contained within is unlike anything you have ever encountered,
and you don't see any possible way you could counteract and
beat this kind of power.

But then, you see something unusual.

On the top of the crystal, you see a small recess. A small,
gem shaped recess. You remove the gem from you pouch, and
find that it fits perfectly into the Prism.

As the gem fits into place, the crystal instantly loses its
lumincescence while at the sime time, the torches that light
the room all go out at the same time. There is a moment of
silence and blackness.

But only for a second.

Suddenly you are flying backwards through the air and smash
painfully into the wall with such a force that you end up
sitting inside a huge recess you created with the impact of
your body.

The energy released from the Prism is Awesome. Like yourself,
everything else in the room is taken by the force and is
pushed to the walls, leaving nothing but the Prism in the
middle. You cannot be sure, but you think you can the sound
of the entire Palace shaking and large structures crashing
against the structure. The room shakes. The ground shakes.

The Palace shakes....

The last thought you have before being hit in the head with
a large stone and being knocked unconcious is that you need 
to get out of here before the whole Palace crashes down on 
itself....
