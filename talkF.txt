	work in this village tending shops, some work outside
	the village and grow food for the rest of us to eat,
	some work for the village to repair buildings and 
	keep it clean. You get the idea. There is a lovely
	little clothing shop to the east. Dario runs the 
	place. He is a little strange, but he is harmless.
	Bailey's Blacksmith is to the south, and she is 
	the best I have ever seen."

	truth, I do not know much more about the town. I spend
	a lot of my time out in the woods. I love it out there,
	and you can always find something new! Although I have
	not been out much as of late. I lost my compass and
	now it is harder for me to get a bearing on where I am.
	That forest can be a maze sometimes!"
SETH:

BAILEY:

	stranger to this land?"
SETH:
	"Indeed I am. My name is Seth. Maxine told me about
	you, as well as Lucious. I wanted to see the best
	weapons this land had to offer first hand."
BAILEY:
	"Ah, ye flatter me, Seth. I do the best I can here. 
	Take a look around at your leisure. Me name's Bailey,
	and I run this here shop. Let me know if I can assist
	ye in anything."
SETH:

	I take it?"
BAILEY:
	"Aye, it is roarin'. So much so that I can't seem to get
	a tick of time to meself these days. Always working on
	some axe or some sword that the Palace needs fixed up.
	Alas, even if I could get out, t'would be of no use."
SETH:
	"What do you mean? You don't like to go out?"
BAILEY:
	"I wish more than anything that it were possible. I am
	somewhat known around these parts. So much so that 
	whenever I go out into the town, I can't get around
	without the townspeople wanting to talk. I ain't got
	time for that!"
SETH:
	"I apologize, but I have never heard of you. What are you
	known for?"

	upon some kind of disguise, I would be most appreciative
	of ye. I have to get back to work. To much to do, Seth.
	Too much to do. Let me know if I can help ye."

	"You did it, didn't you? I can feel it. The land has
	finally been freed of this curse put upon it. The 
	time has come for me to divulge to you everything I
	know.

	The Spell put upon this town, which had been anchored
	by the clock tower, left the people who lived within
	it's walls in a state of recursion. Every day that
	went by was forgotten upon the waking of each new
	day. Thus, everyday was the same day as it had been 
	when they went to sleep.

	This means that for as long as the spell has been in
	use, the town has lived in a cycle of one day over
	and over."
SETH:
	"Then I will ask the obvious question. How long has 
	this spell been cast. How long have the people been
	living the same day?"
VINCENT:
	"The answer to that question also contains the purpose
	of the Basileus' actions. You see, not only do the
	people of Galilei live the same day continuously, but
	their bodies seem to live the same day continuously as
	well. This means that as each day goes by, they do not

SETH:

VINCENT:
	"We have been here for a long time. So long that we
	have no partners in trade. We have no foreign tourists.
	No one in the world knows we exist, as everyone in the
	land has been here for 244 years. This was all part of
	Maidoin's plan. The purpose of the spell was so that
	he could piggyback on the side effect of never aging.
	He now has as much time as he needs to accomplish his
	wicked goals."
SETH:
	"244 years. I cannot even fathom this period of time.
	I am most worried about what Maiodin has accomplished
	so far."
VINCENT:
	"It is safe to say thay he accomplished enough. The
	most notable of these accomplishments was the 
	descovery of an ancient, mysterious artifact. The
	only thing I know about it is it's name. The Prism
	of Aestralius. It is unfathomably powerfull, and I am
	sure Maiodin does not understand it's full
	capabilities. However, he knows enough, and has spent
	years researching how to use it. I fear that he is
	ready to use it, and I have no idea what that will
	mean for all of us."
SETH:
	"But I have the orb. The curse has been broken. Does
	this not mean that the Basileus' power has broken
	as well?"
VINCENT:
	"I do not believe your presence here is by accident,
	Seth. This is a time of reckoning. The final conflict
	is upon us, and you have been chosen. I do not know
	how this ends, but I know that it is you who must
	confront Maiodin. You are the only who can defeat him.
	You have broken his curse, and restored the land. It
	will take time, but soon, the people will remember.
SETH:
	"Alright, then. It seems I do not have a choice, and
	it is the only way I can ever have hope of returning
	home.

	What must I do, Vincent? How do I defeat the Basileus?"
VINCENT:
	"I can tell you the way through these tunnels that
	will bring you directly to his inner chamber. Actually,
	the path leads through a very important room. This
	room contains something you will need, so make sure to
	search it thoroughly.
	
	I do not know exactly how to defeat the Basileus, but
	I trust you will find a way. If he has activated the
	prism, you will need to stop it. I assume you will
	need to subdue Maiodin first, so focus on him right
	away. You can do it, Seth. Go east from here to find
	the way."
SETH:

	again in better times. What will you do?"

	time since I have been there, and I am guessing
	the people will be very confused. I must talk with
	Bailey, especially."
SETH:

	Basileus came to power."
VINCENT:
	"That is correct Seth. You are sharp, indeed. She was
	the Queen, and a beloved Queen at that. Maiodin didn't
	want to waste her talents, so he put her in the
	Blacksmith. With little surprise, she is one of the
	best. Unforunately, most of her work goes directly to
	Maiodin.

	The time has come, Seth. No more delay can be tolerated.
	Head east from here. Think about what I said.

VINCENT:

	within those walls, however, are not actions of those
	with free will."
SETH:
	"They are being controlled?"
VINCENT:
	"In many ways, yes. But not in the way you are
	thinking.

	I have known the Basileus for much of my life. In 
	fact, there was a time where you might call us
	'friends'. We grew up together in a very small village
	far from here."
SETH:
	"He was a commoner? How could that be? How could he
	be the Lord of this land?"
VINCENT:
	"Treason, Seth. In many different forms. Maiodin always
	had a thirst for power. It was one of the ways in which
	we had always disagreed. Eventually, he became overcome
	with his need for power. He believed he was better
	then the rest of the world, as though he had a
	perspective that transended everyone else. 

	In his search, after years of study and exploration,
	he found this little town of Galilei, and decided
	it was perfect for his plans. This is where things
	get a little strange.

	Indeed, this town is not what it seems, Seth. Before
	the Basileus took over, this land had a different
	leader. A very kind, just, and prosperous leader. It
	was a Queen, in fact. She was loved by the people, and
	they worked hard for her and for the good of the land.
	This led to a peace that lasted for years, and in a way
	had much to do with how simple it was for Maiodin to
	take over. He did not come with an army. There was no
	battle at all. He used magic, and a strange technology
	that I have yet to fully understand. 

	He subdued the town, and erased their memories of the
	former life they had lived. Now, they believe he has
	always been their leader, and blindly follow his
	orders."
SETH:
	"How? How did he do this?"
VINCENT:
	"In the center of the town, there is a stucture that
	used to be a large fountain. You have most likely
	encountered it, but thought nothing of it."
SETH:
	"The clock?"
VINCENT:
	"Yes. This structure is much more than a clock that no
	longer works. It is the source of Maiodin's power.
	Without it, his hold on the people of Galilei would
	cease.
	
	Seth, you must break this hold. You must disrupt this
	source of power. It is the only way to return the town
	back to normal, and the only way to defeat the
	Basileus. Once you do this, I will tell you eveything
	else you need to know."
SETH:
	"What must I do? I noticed the clock was no longer
	working, but I did not see much else."
VINCENT:
	"The only way to reset the clock is to find the 
	clock hands and set it to the correct time. It is the
	exact minute the Basileus cast his spell. I do not
	know the exact time, but I can help you find it. You
	have visited the Blacksmith, yes?"
SETH:
	"Yes, Bailey's shop."
VINCENT:
	"Bailey has a large role in all of this, but all you
	need to know right now is that there exists a sign
	in her shop which is the key for the clock. It will 
	contain many strange symbols and numbers. You must find
	it, and decipher the code:
		
			$ : * ()

	Remember this code. You will need it. Once you find
	the secret of the clock tower, come back here, and we
	will win this battle together."

	"If you could, you would have done it already. I
	have nothing to lose. I am way too far into this to
	turn back now. As you have pointed out, I am digging
	around under the Palace in order to find out more
	about the Basileus."
VINCENT:
	"You gamble well. What is your name?"
SETH:
	"Seth."
VINCENT:
	"Well met, Seth. I am Vincent. It just so happens that
	if you are looking for information about the Basileus,
	I may be of service. If you are looking to use this
	informations against Maiodin, I will be even more
	inclined to help you."
SETH:
	"Considering my journey so far, this is refreshing to
	hear. Indeed, I understand there is something very 
	strange going on in the town."
VINCENT:
	"Yes, Seth. There is. Tell me, what do you know?"
SETH:
	"Very little. It seems the townspeople are all very
	friendly, accepting, and helpful. I have spoken with
	most of them, and they all seem normal. At a certain
	point in our conversations, however, there will be
	a moment of confusion. Something they should be able
	to recall, or information they should know, they 
	can't recall. Many times, they have a hard time
	resuming the conversation. I have tried to discern
	the source, but I cannot understand why this might be
	happening."
VINCENT:
	"I can tell you why this is happening."
SETH:
	"Please do."
VINCENT:
	"Not so fast, Seth. I know you are rather new to this
	part of the world. However, I have been here a long
	time. Longer than you can imagine. If I am going
	to divulge this information to you, I need to know
	I can trust you."
SETH:
	"What do you need from me, Vincent?"
VINCENT:
	"Hmmm. As of late, it seems the Basileus has become
	increasingly aware of my presence. I may have need
	to defend myself, but all I really have are these
	walls. If you can find me something with which to
	defend myself, I would be grateful. I would also
	be willing to trust you to do what needs to be done."
SETH:
	"I shall do my best to find that which would help you.
	Hang tight, Vincent."

You don't think it is a very good idea to alert Maiodin of 
your presence. You decide to stay hidden so you can figure out
how to stop him!
